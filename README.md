# Design process
The design process for this project was all done using Miro, a cross-device collaboration whiteboard platform. 
## Diagrams, wireframes and mockups
* All of my design process is located on my [miro](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lZip5fU=/) design board

## Typography
The two fonts I selected are Roboto and Open-sans, both from [GoogleFonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
Roboto was used for the navigational links and all of my titles/subtitles. For my main body of content, I used Open-sans. I used this combination as I liked the simplistic modern look of them both and the way they complement each other.

## Colour scheme
The colour pallet was used making [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/). I already planned to have different shades of grey and a shade of red to add a splash of colour. I chose this pallet because In my mind it closely reflects Kendrick Lamars style

#  Features

## Navigation

The Navigation bar is designed using Bootstap's navbar which is fixed in a horizontal position to the top. So as the users are scrolling down the webpage the Navbar will at the top of the screen for a good user experience across the whole website. I styled the navbar using the darker grey in my colour pallet and the nav links in a lighter grey so they can still be clearly seen and a hover effect of a Chinese red which is activated by hovering your mouse over the nav links. I also changed the hamburger icon background to the Chinese red to fit better with the styling of the navbar and overall website.
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

## Footer

My footer will be styled with the same darker grey used in my navbar, it will include social media links that will direct you to Kendrick Lamar's Social media profiles as well as streaming service links which will take you to his artist page on the corresponding streaming service. These links will be displayed using the corresponding icons from Fontawsome. They will have identical hover effects as the navbar

## Home

The home page has a brief introduction about who Kendrick Lamar is with a link to his bio page followed by an announcement about his new single with the artwork for the single to go along with it. and to finish one of Kendricks music videos embedded underneath. I have done this for a reason. As soon as you enter the page there are 3 options of being directed to informative text about Kendrick for the fans that want to read about him or one oh his new songs for people that would like to hear his style of music. Finalised by a music video for the people that would like something visual.

## Music

This page contains Kendrick's the tracklist and album art for his 3 latest albums with links to either stream or purchase the albums accordingly. This gives the user easy access to his music which when prompted will have a chance for Kendrick to gain more streams from users that have been directed there from the website.

## About

This being here gives another reason for users to come to the website and explore the other pages.
